# Arrate01-Repository-for-Fluctuations-in-Jupiter-s-Equatorial-Stratospheric-Oscillation

Antuñano et al. (2020) used Jupiter 7.6-7.9 µm data captured by 5 different ground-based instruments mounted on the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Maunakea, Hawai'i, between 1980 and 2011, to characterize the long-term behaviour of Jupiter's Quasi-Quadrennial Oscillation (QQO) and to determine whether, like the Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) or Saturn's Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO), the QQO can be disrupted by tropospheric convective events and/or stratospheric perturbations.

This repository contains the cylindrical maps (cmap.fits) and the corresponding emission angle files (mu.fits) of Jupiter's 7.6-7.9-µm images from 1984-2011 used to compute the zonal-mean brightness temperatures as a function of latitude and date shown in Antuñano et al. (2020). The data are organized by year.
